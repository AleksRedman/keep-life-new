My name is Serhii Nechitailenko. I am the head of the Keep Life project. These are mobile stabilization points for the front line

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:31.020
Depending on the complexity of the operation, this stabilization point can accommodate up to 60 people.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.820
The autonomy of this complex is provided by diesel generators.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:42.670
Water in the conditions in which they work for an average of 10-12 hours, and diesel lighting will be enough

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:48.250
for 50 hours of uninterrupted work, this complex can be developed in an average of 20 minutes

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.440
from arrival at the scene

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.290
For the first, they are always difficult

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.890
We test them out, surgeons help us. Today is generally a wonderful day - we have 2 surgeons

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:10.390
1 came from the front from our first module and the surgeon who will pick up the module today also came from another direction.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.960
In this version, we have 2 surgical tables, this is a full-fledged surgery

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:26.100
resuscitation and dressing for two brigades. There are shadowless lamps here,

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.320
an oxygen concentrator, there is a ventilator, a patient condition monitor and we have a defibrillator,

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.790
we have an autoclave for sterilizing surgical instruments, which means that it is possible

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:47.850
In fact, everything you can wish for, and the rest is already done by each narrow-profile specialist who will perform his task here

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:55.790
he will already pull up for himself what, conditionally, he will not have enough of
